To achieve this goal, the following steps can be taken using Power Query:



1. Clean and prepare the data by removing irrelevant or redundant information, and transforming data to an appropriate format.

2. Check the data and its data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.

3. Identify and address blank cells to avoid incorrect or biased analysis.

4. Find missing values and determine whether to fill them or exclude them from the analysis.

5. Remove duplicates to avoid duplicated analysis results.

6. Remove columns with constant values as they do not contribute to the analysis.
